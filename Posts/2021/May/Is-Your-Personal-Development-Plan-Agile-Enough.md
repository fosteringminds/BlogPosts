# Is Your Personal Development Plan Agile Enough

## Time is finite

I turned 40 last year - I have potentially lived 50% of my life already. It's a scary thought. We do not get extra days allocated in our "life" account everyday. I'm not trying to be sombre here - but when people say life is short they are not kidding. As I've grown older it feels as if the time between each new December has become shorter. We are already in the month of May - 4 months from now I would have already celebrated another birthday. My son would have turned one. Another year of being married would have come and gone. And it always feels as if reaching September in the year means things are already heading a certain direction. The year is already on its back. The seasons start changing again - we will be heading into summer. Three months on from September it is December. Another Christmas lies ahead. A New Year's eve. Then it "starts again". Only it never really starts again - you just get older. Time appears to go by quicker as you get older. An avalanche you can either choose to watch go by - or you can choose to ride it. Maybe a wave is a better metaphor - avalanches are quite destructive. The point though - life is this unstoppable wave. Whether you do something at any given point in your life or not the time goes by. Time is not some rechargeable voucher either. You cannot login to an app to buy more "life" airtime. There are no in-app purchases. Everyday you live is one closer to your last. Death is inevitable. You have a choice - as with so much in life. You can have a plan for your life - or not. Not having a plan may seem alluring at first but let me tell you from personal experience being lost is not a good thing, at all. Not having a plan - "just going along with it" may seem romantic at first. The downside though - you can easily get lost. Time wasted on being lost is never recouperated. I sometimes think this notion of just going along with it has to do with wanting to cruise too much. Have the good things without the effort. 

## Planning your life does not mean knowing the future

I cannot tell you what the future holds. Maybe such individuals exist somewhere. I'm not one of them. Something I have realised though - having a plan for your life has nothing to do with knowing what the future will bring. Having a plan simply means knowing where you want to be with your life. It means knowing the actions you need to take to get to the realise your potential. Potential is deeply personal. It does not imply how others see you - its how you see yourself. If you know you can do better - if you want better for yourself its not dependent on how people see you. In saying that you do need people along the way to achieve success. You can only go so far on your own. Influencing others to help you will be crucial to your success. It begs the question whether you helping others has as much an impact on your success as them helping you. Helping others without ego or an expectation on return is the ultimate influencer. When you influence people - they are more likely to want to help you. People who feel obliged to help you versus wanting to help you is significant.

Having a plan requires discipline. Then again the plan you have should be guided by your purpose in life. Your purpose is fueled by your passion. It will require discipline to achieve your goals but not in a miltary sense. Having passion for what you do should ideally not require a lot of effort. It comes naturally. Discipline could be a question of focus rather than a question of being overly dilligent. Discipline should not mean lacking compassion or forgiveness to others in getting to the end-goal. Compassion and forgiveness starts with you. Can you really be compassionate and forgiving to others if you are not with yourself? Discipline can also mean knowing when to quit. Spending countless hours on a problem requires seeing it differently. Seeing it differently means knowing when to stop. Discipline has for many years had a forcefulness to it in my mind at least - it has felt almost military. The discipline required to achieve your goals should require very little motivation. 

## Planning should not be too brittle

One of my personal goals is to master several areas. One of them is Entity Framework Core.
